# Lab 02-Class05-Day 1 of 1 day lab: Deploy and Extend Your Portfolio

## Today's lab topic: Deploy and Extend Your Portfolio

## This readme provides an overview of the project for a new visitor to my repo

I am getting ready to take a look at a full-featured code base! I have just started a new job and the employer wants me to demonstrate my skills by building a portfolio using React. This should highlight my knowledge of the React library and my ability to explore a new codebase. The starter template https://www.npmjs.com/package/cra-template-react-portfolio for today contains a complete React + Bootstrap site with example pages, icons, styles, and a themed layouts. My job is to customize this code by following the specifications in the Trello board.

I will be deploying my React portfolio to Netlify https://www.netlify.com/.
